## 🙊 Languages

Spent many years as a developer. Started with low-level languages like [C](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language) and [C++](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp), then moved to higher-level languages like [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/), [Java](https://www.java.com), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html), [Powershell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) and [*Web Languages*](https://leftoversalad.com/c/015_programmingpeople/).

I've gained proficiency in many languages through small personal projects.

I am currently focusing on [Go](https://go.dev/) for my personal projects.
